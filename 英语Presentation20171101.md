Hello, everyone, we are Group ________. It is my honour to stand here to introduce our presentation, whose topic is 'The Influence of MOOC on our study or education'. 

As you can see, firstly, we'll explain '**what is MOOC**'. And then we'll show you **the positive factors as well as negative factors of MOOC on us**. After that, we're going to share with all of you **some experience of MOOC from our classmates**. And finally, we're going to give out suggestions about **how to make better use of MOOC**. Each part of our presentation will be about 5 minutes. 

Okay, before we talk about the influence of MOOC, it is obvious that we should know what is MOOC first. So now, please Welcome Zankai, who will introduce MOOC itself for us!
